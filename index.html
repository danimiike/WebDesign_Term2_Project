                    10 First Days in London - Canada
                </h2>

                    This webpage is dedicated to help international students, specially who came with kids not be lost when arrive in London! Here you will find what to do in the first 10 days after arrived. This is about my personal experience with a family of four people. I came to study at Fanshawe and my husband will work during this time to help with the daily expenses. Because I am studying in a Public College the kids can go to a public school as well.

                    We know that without a detailed planning this experience could turn into a nightmare, then we spend the last 4 years building our planning. It is not the intention of this webpage to encourage or detail how we made our plan. I am not an immigration consultant and I do not provide services for this purpose. My intention is just to facilitate the arrival of families through my family's experience… let’s start it!!!
