                        Moving day. We had some help from Brazilian neighbor, but if there is no one to help you can rent a little truck through u-haul or a big SUV or Van. We had the mission of making the house habitable, there was several finishing problems, leaks that people fix over the days. We had seen the house before the renovation through a video made by Julia, and the changes were incredible. They changed the floor of the whole house, delivered a brand-new refrigerator, stove, hood, washing machine and clothes dryer. It is not common in my country. We received the mattresses and then we went back to Tbooth to hire the internet plan for home. We ended up taking Virgin's 60 mb speed, unlimited data and with a first-year discount it went for $ 30 + tax. The only drawback is that the installation would only be on Wednesday. We went to Walmart and Dollarama to buy more things for the house, we spend a significant amount of money with little daily things for kitchen, bathroom and some decoration, so be prepared.

                        Shoppingâ€¦arriving in a new place it is very hard, we do not know where to go and where is cheaper, we got completely lost. Through tips that people who already live here, we discovered an app called Flipp that centralize flyers of many establishments in the region of Canada, it allows us to search what we need and find the better price. But do not limit yourself to this, online searches are very helpful too. Many stores have Refurbished devices that really worth it, especially if it has warranty.

                        Credit Score, a very important point here in Canada that represents your financial life in that territory. Thinking of composing our Credit Score, we wait for her credit card to arrive to make the heaviest purchases of furniture and things for home. As the card limit is low, we made a transfer from the current account to the card to increase the limit and be able to use it without having to pay it all the time and do not take the risk of exceeding the limit. Other thing that may increase your score is to pay your bills on time (hydro, wyse, internet, etc.). You also can pay the college tuition through the credit card, but do be able to do it you should call your bank manager to know how to proceed.

                        We went to the Thames Valley School Board to get permission to enroll the boys in a public school. Once there, we went to the international office room where they asked for passports, visas, permits, Loa and proof of address (we took a copy of the rental contract). We were taken to a computer to fill in Gustavo and Ian's online application, then we returned to the room and we were handed the yellow paper and with it we will go to the school next week to register. We are at the end of the school year now, and they will start in the next school year that starts in September / 2019.

                        Internet installation day and receive the sofa we bought on Sunday at Teppermans website. Both called on Monday confirming the delivery and schedule time. At 7:40 am Dani received a message from Virgin saying that the installer was on his way, he arrived at 7:50 am but was waiting in the car until 8 am to knock on the door. Installed everything in 30 min. Then the sofa arrived, and 15 minutes later they set up and positioned it where we asked. Amazing how things work here. In the afternoon my husband started assembler the boys' dresser. People here is used to assemble furniture by themselves, it is called DIY (Do It Yourself). He spent about 4 hours assembling the dresser, it was not very hard because there is a guide which came with the dresser.
