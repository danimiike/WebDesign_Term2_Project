                <h3>Day 1</h3>
                <p class = "dayone">
                    We landed in Toronto at 5 am., after passed immigration we were directed to a room where we picked up the PERMITS (study to me and kids, and work to my husband).Then we had the opportunity to get the SIN in a room next door, it was very fast.
                    We hired a company to do our transfer. We arrived in London on Airbnb just before 10 am, and went to get the car reserved at Hertz for 1 week.
                    We opened Scotiabank account, student account for me and newcomer for my husband (both free of charge). We left with a debit card and the credit card was only granted to me, and would arrive within 5 business days.

                    We bought cell lines at Masonville Mall in Tbooth store. We get 8GB / $ 50 per month without a contract because we used our devices. We hired Fido, the coverage in London is good, despite having some city spots that we have a very weak signal it is serving to us at the beginning.

                    We went downtown to get the LTC taps. Children from 5 to 12 years old do not pay for buses here but need a tap (no costs - shown in the picture). We took the opportunity to buy 10 bus tickets for $ 19.
                    Downtown, as expected, is more boring to park. We stayed in a public parking lot for $ 6 30 min and then we saw that we had the option to stop on the Market side using the parking meter.
                    In the afternoon we went to see the south side of London and stopped at Springbank Park. That day we also went to Walmart and bought a Canon multifunctional printer for $ 59, because we needed to make some copies and print our Brazilian license driver’s documents to send to Brazilian Consulate.

                <p class = "dayfour"> 
               
                    We went in Scotiabank to get two money orders (as if it were a Brazilian cashier's check) to send to the Consulate for $ 22.50 each (tax to verify our driver’s license in Brazil). Each money order was priced at $ 7.50. We went to the Canada Post to send the documents to validate our driver’s qualification by the Consulate. Authenticated and simple copies of Brazilian driver’s license passports, Detran document that shows when our first driver’s license was taken and points history to prove that your driver’s license is not suspended, and a money order for each of $ 22.50. We buy an envelope for sending and one for return + - $ 17 each, and send it to the Consulate. With the return of the Consulate's validation, we were able to take the theoretical test of Canadian driver’s license G1 and then practice G2 or G Full. Without this document, we would have to follow the normal process deadlines, which means that you can only take G2 after 1 year with G1 and G Full after 1 year with G2. After that, we went to see furniture and buy the mattresses for the new house. We opted for AA Mattress because it has a great cost benefit and free and fast delivery.

                    We signed the lease contract and got our new home’s key. We rent this townhouse from Brazil with a Brazilian woman who helps family arrive in London with a house rented, she is very professional and her work saved us lots of time and money. We went in School Board to enroll the kids in a public school, but the international office was open from 9:30 am to 2:00 pm so we left it for the next work day. We went to get our first item purchased at the Mackenzie auction, very interesting for those who have a tight budget to house’s furnish. We made the first heavy purchase at Walmart for cleaning products and basic items (vacuum cleaner, cookware, bedding, etc.).
