                    My name is Danielle, I've known my husband Edson for 20 years. I am from Rio de Janeiro but I lived in Sao Paulo since I was 4 years old, He is from Sao Paulo. We started dating in 1999 on a trip to Ilha Comprida, south coast of Sao Paulo. We got married in 2005. After a few years enjoying life as a couple, we realized that something was missing to complete this union, and 6 years after the wedding, in December / 2011, our dear Gustavo was born. We saw our life change completely and that little human being made us see life with different perspectives, other purposes. But there was still a piece missing in our puzzle, and then two years later, in January / 2014 we were presented with Ian.

                    I do not know exactly when the idea to came to Canada appears in my mind, but with the growing violence and low future perspective I decided that we should leave that country. It was a hard decision because all my family and friends stayed there, and when you have children the difficulties are bigger than when you came by yourself. My English was not good (and It do not change much), so I had to push myself to study to get enough marks in the English test (IELTS). This planning got four years because it should be carefully planned. After I arrived here, I realized that those four years was, actually, the easy partâ€¦ the real challenges were just about to beginning.
